1.  Introduction

   *  MIMI currently doesn't make assumptions about names beyond the URI
      format introduced in [I-D.draft-ietf-mimi-protocol]

   *  Different messaging applications use different schemes

   *  MIMI should be able to support at least the most widely used ones

2.  Identifier types

2.1.  Identifiers for connection establishment

   *  Globally unique

   *  User-facing

   *  Often chosen by user

   *  Multiple identifiers per user possible

   *  User can add/delete identifiers dynamically

   *  Examples:

      -  Phone numbers

      -  Signal-style usernames

      -  Matrix-style usernames

      -  Administrative identifiers

2.2.  Administrative identifiers

   *  Globally unique

   *  Generally not user-facing

   *  Generally not chosen-facing

   *  Can be provider-generated

   *  Server might not be able to link admin to connection establishment
      identifiers

   *  Immutable

   *  Examples

      -  UUIDs

      -  Matrix-style usernames

2.3.  Display names (decorative identifiers)

   *  Not globally unique

   *  Not necessarily visible to provider

   *  User-facing

   *  User-chosen

3.  Proposal for MIMI

3.1.  Connection establishment

   *  Multiple options for connection establishment identifiers

      -  Phone numbers (draft WIP)

      -  Usernames (user chosen names, potentially with format
         restrictions)

   *  No requirement for providers to be able to link connection
      establishment identifiers with administrative identifiers

   *  Ephemeral identifiers should be allowed

3.2.  Administrative identifiers

   *  Should be unique within domain of provider

   *  Should be immutable

   *  No other requirement w.r.t. format, i.e. both Matrix-style and
      UUIDs allowed

   *  No requirement for user-readability

   *  These are used for authentication and are included in MLS
      credentials

3.3.  Display names

   *  No strict requirement for hub/provider to have access to display
      names, may be subject to policy

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
